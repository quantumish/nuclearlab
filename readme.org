#+TITLE: Radiation Absorption Lab

* About
This repository stores the code used to determine half-thicknesses of various materials as well generate tables/figures for the associated lab report. It also contains the data analyzed to create all these and should be entirely reproducible.

The full report this was made for can be seen [[file:./report.pdf][here]].

Dependencies: SciPy, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and a working LaTeX installation.
* Expected Output

The program should print the following to stdout:

#+BEGIN_SRC:
Name		T_best	T_min	T_max	S_min	N-1
plasticorange	0.8736	0.4466	8.7385	0.0	1
plasticgreen	0.0564	0.0448	0.0737	2.356	4
tissueyellow	1.0371	0.9314	1.1536	0.3733	6
leadgreen	0.0012	0	10000000	0.0022	1
aluminumgreen	0.0259	0.0229	0.0292	3.5908	10
leadorange	0.4391	0.368	0.5369	3.129	4
aluminumorange	1.7843	0.918	19.9563	3.5532	11
#+END_SRC

The program should also display the following graph:

Uncommenting the line at the bottom that calls the function to the draw the shifted S-statistic should yield the following.
